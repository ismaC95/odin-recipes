        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Even a novice cook can master the art of perfect pizza with our step-by-step guide. This homemade pizza recipe features a simple pizza dough and toppings.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>For the base:</p>
            <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
            <li>instant yeast</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <p>For the tomato sauce:</p>
            <li>100ml passata</li>
            <li>handful fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        </ol>
